placempus,"**Is it a fish? – Is it a squid? – Or is it something completely different?** 

You can spectate the birth of a very rare see creature. The Placempus arises from it’s coral like mother tube and tears of the umbilical chord.","**A new underwater creature was born. The Placempus is a made up being with diverse references to existing marine life forms. It’s birth is inspired by the birth of invertebrates.**

The body of the Placempus thereby represents the uterus, while – instead of an umbilical cord – an octopus’ tentacle is connected to the placenta on the inside. Another big influence to the mechanism of birth of the Placempus were the cnidocytes, extraordinary cells of jellyfish which have the capability to perform abrupt defense mechanisms similar to a harpoon shooting. The pulsing swimming movement is also inspired by jellyfish, while the bounciness and rotational component was influenced by a reference video of a nervous pufferfish. The challenge of designing the movement was it, to convey the feeling of a rather conscious animal with the instinct to rip off its umbilical cord on its own. The rather useless small fins on top of the Placempus are also inspired by the puffed pufferfish’s footage and support the feeling of effort.

Design wise it was my main con- ceptual concern to make a strong visual connection between the mother-tubes, inspired by sponge colonies with sea anemone on top, and the baby Placempus. I made match therefore and decided to add a strong and appealing visual connection through adding the scales. The colors are inspired by reference images of oyster scales and flesh.",Denmark,2020,HDV,"Houdini, Nuke",Mantra,1920x1080,16:9,No Sound,14’’,,
boddyssey,"This experimental Anidok shows the collapse of another ecosystem out of skin and human limbs. Birth and reproduction lead to a lack of life giving ressources and therefore to a over use of the hairy lands. What remains is death, decay and lifelong scars in the the skin that disappears only at the horizon.","A 99% procedural film. Everything in this film is generated with SideFX Houdinis core toolset. There are no textures imported from external sources and all the modeling and animation is done within Houdinis SOP context.

spark_of_genius,A science professor working in his laboratory runs after an insolent light bulb to complete his colorBright formula with a spark of genius.,"Spark of Genius was a commissioned work for Cartoon Network Germany. I was responsible for modeling, texturing, effects and rendering. It was a nice collaboration also with international students from Italy, Elena Felici and Belgium, Felix Isenbaert. We had to figure out a lot, because the interests and strength lay in very different fields. But wen finally managed to create this woderful 2D/3D-mixed animation project.
