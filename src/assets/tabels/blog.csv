06/27/19,Umbilical Tentacle,"The umbilical chord, which is connected inside of the placempus is inspired by octopus tentacles. 

Modeling it procedurally gives the opportunity to later reuse it and adapt it for other projects and probabely create a Houdini Digital asset out of it. 
Putting these additional thoughts about reusability is something I always do. It takes some more time but eventually it will pay off.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/tyb4f201rx731jw/blog_placempus_nobs.gif?raw=1,,"blog, placempus, houdini"
06/15/19,Scales Tool,"Also for the scales of the Placempus I wanted to create a tool. I wanted to have the freedom to decide later how big the scales should be on top of the mother tubes and the new born itself.

05/26/19,Placempus Main Concept,"To conceptualize the placempus it felt easier to use rather scematic drawings. It was easier to showcase all the important parts it's supposed to have. 
It looks a bit like an illustration you would find in a biology book. ",https://www.dropbox.com/s/filwbtl6h0ho4le/blog_placempus_main_concept.jpg?raw=1,,"blog, placempus, concept, drawing, sketch"
